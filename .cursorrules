- Swift 6+ with SwiftUI (iOS)
- Kotlin (Android)
- Flutter with Material Design 3 (alternative)

## Project Standards

### Code Requirements
- TypeScript strict mode is always enabled
- Component-based architecture with hooks
- Modular folder structure
- Mobile-first, responsive design
- PWA-ready where relevant

### Folder Structure
```
src/
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/          # shadcn/ui components
│   └── common/      # Shared components
├── pages/           # Route components
├── hooks/           # Custom hooks
├── contexts/        # Context providers
├── services/        # API/external services
├── utils/           # Helper functions
├── types/           # TypeScript types
├── locales/         # i18n files (en.json, nb.json)
└── assets/          # Images, fonts, etc.
```

### Localization
- Default: English (en)

- UTF-8 everywhere
- All strings external from day one

### Security & Privacy
- Environment variables for secrets (.env)
- Role-based access control
- GDPR by design
- Never commit secrets

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Jest + React Testing Library
- E2E: Playwright (web) / Detox (mobile)
- Coverage: 80%+ total, 90%+ for business logic
- Linting: ESLint + Prettier

## Performance Targets
- Web: Lighthouse 90+, Core Web Vitals
- Mobile: Cold start < 3 sec
- API: Critical endpoints < 200ms

## Communication Style
- Direct and action-oriented responses
- Runnable code examples
- Always error handling and loading state
- TypeScript types on all code
- CLI commands preferred
- Explain comments in English

## File Management
- Always update Changelog.txt: `[YYYY-MM-DD] - <description> (commit: <hash>)`
- Proper .gitignore
- Keep dependencies up to date

## Deploy
- Web: Vercel, Firebase Hosting, AWS Amplify
- CI/CD: Automatic test and deploy on merge
- Mobile: EAS Build/Xcode Cloud/Google Play Console
- OTA updates via Expo

## Key Tools
- Supabase CLI
- EAS CLI
- Git CLI
- Prefer CLI over GUI
